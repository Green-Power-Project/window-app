## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Firebase project with Authentication, Firestore, and Storage enabled

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password provider)
   - Create a Firestore database (start in test mode, then update rules)
   - Enable Storage
   - Copy your Firebase config
   
   **Firestore Security Rules** (set in Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules):
   Include rules for **projects** and for **folder chat** (per-folder two-way chat). If you already have other rules, add the `folderConversations` and `folderConversations/.../messages` blocks inside your existing `match /databases/{database}/documents { ... }`.
   See the project root file **`firestore.rules`** for the full folder-chat rules to copy. Summary:
   - **folderConversations**: allow read/write if the user is in the `admins` collection, or if they are the customer of the project (project’s `customerId` equals `request.auth.uid`).
   - **folderConversations/{convId}/messages**: same logic using the parent conversation’s `projectId`.
   Minimal example including projects + folder chat:
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /projects/{projectId} {
         allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.customerId;
         allow create, update, delete: if false;
       }
       match /folderConversations/{convId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && (
           exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/admins/$(request.auth.uid))
           || (request.resource != null && 'projectId' in request.resource.data && (let p = get(/databases/$(database)/documents/projects/$(request.resource.data.projectId)); p.data != null && p.data.customerId == request.auth.uid))
           || (resource != null && 'projectId' in resource.data && (let p = get(/databases/$(database)/documents/projects/$(resource.data.projectId)); p.data != null && p.data.customerId == request.auth.uid))
         );
       }
       match /folderConversations/{convId}/messages/{msgId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && (
           exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/admins/$(request.auth.uid))
           || (let conv = get(/databases/$(database)/documents/folderConversations/$(convId)); conv.data != null && 'projectId' in conv.data && (let p = get(/databases/$(database)/documents/projects/$(conv.data.projectId)); p.data != null && p.data.customerId == request.auth.uid))
         );
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   **Projects Collection Structure:**
   Projects must be created manually by administrators. Each project document should have:
   - `name` (string, required): Project name
   - `year` (number, optional): Project year
   - `customerId` (string, required): Firebase Auth UID of the customer
   
   **File Read Tracking:**
   - New files uploaded by admin are considered Unread
   - Unread files appear in `00_New_Not_Viewed_Yet_` folder
   - When customer opens/downloads a file, it's marked as Read
   - Read files are removed from `00_New_Not_Viewed_Yet_` but remain in original folder
   - Read status is stored in `fileReadStatus` Firestore collection
   
   **Storage Security Rules** (set in Firebase Console):
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service firebase.storage {
     match /b/{bucket}/o {
       // Project files: Customers can read all files, upload only to 01_Customer_Uploads
       match /projects/{projectId}/{folderPath=**} {
         allow read: if request.auth != null;
         allow write: if request.auth != null && folderPath.matches('01_Customer_Uploads.*');
         allow delete: if false; // Customers cannot delete files
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   **File Upload Restrictions:**
   - Allowed file types: PDF, JPG, PNG
   - Maximum file size: 20 MB
   - Upload location: Only `01_Customer_Uploads` and its subfolders
   - Customers can view and download all files in their projects
   - Customers cannot delete or edit files

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
